Hello everyone, now I show you the vision test demo3.0 version based on the C865 development kit. This version adds the application scenario of vision test on the basis of 2.0. In the upper left corner of the display, 20 kinds of "E" of different sizes and directions will be displayed in sequence. The tester needs to make gesture judgments based on the direction of "E". If the gesture is correct, go to the next round of testing. If it fails twice in a row, the test ends and the corresponding score is obtained.

Let me introduce my demo scene. First, the IP Camera and C865 are connected under the same LAN. The IP Camera faces the human hand and captures human gestures. C865 connects to the display through HDMI, and C865 obtains rtsp video stream from IP Camera.

Now start the demonstration, open the app, click the settings to add the rtsp video stream, return, click "START", you can see the prompt box, display the test notes, each "E" display lasts 4 seconds, note that the tester needs to make it within 4 seconds Gesture, blindfold one eye and click "START TO TEST" to start the test.
, Below you see the "E" pointing to the right, make the correct gesture, pass, and that's it, we test for a few rounds... Now our simulated tester has been confused, made the wrong gesture, and again Try it once, fail, end the test, and score the corresponding score.Now the test is completed on one eye, test the other eye, and repeat the previous test.
